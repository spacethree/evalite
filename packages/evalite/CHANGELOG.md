# evalite

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 4a8468d: Declare `vitest@^4` as a peer dependency. The package imports `vitest/node` directly but never listed `vitest` in its deps — only `@vitest/runner` and `@vitest/utils`. In a pnpm workspace where the root package has a different vitest version, evalite would walk up Node's module resolution and pick up the wrong vitest, failing with "No test files found" because the v2 vitest API differs from what evalite expects. Declaring it as a peer makes the requirement explicit and lets pnpm resolve it correctly from the consumer.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 11b438e: Initial release of `@spacethree/evalite`, the SpaceThree fork of [evalite](https://github.com/mattpocock/evalite). The fork adds a Postgres storage adapter (`@spacethree/evalite/postgres-storage`) for persisting eval results to PostgreSQL — includes optional `postgres` peer dependency, configurable schema/table names, and conditional test coverage via `EVALITE_TEST_POSTGRES_URL`. Renamed from `evalite` to `@spacethree/evalite` so it can be published to GitHub Packages while we wait on upstream PR review.
